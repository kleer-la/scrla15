    title: About the Coaching Retreat
    subtitle: 3 days, 2 nights, 50 coaches (be one of them)
    text: Scrum Coaching Retreats provide any current or aspiring Agile coaches the opportunity to engage purposefully with their peers, dive deeply into their practices, enhance their skills, and broaden their perspectives to better serve their client organizations. The word 'retreat' was specifically chosen to represent a time away for deep connection, learning, and growth.

    title: 50 coaches (be one of them)
    subtitle: Deep and focused work
    text: There are many events where broad learning takes place -- conferences, gatherings, open space, coaching camps, etc. These events allow for many topics to be covered in a short time and are good for general knowledge sharing. A retreat is designed for narrow and deep focus on a few topics, possibly the same topic pursued by multiple teams from different perspectives. A successful retreat produces not only local event learning but also takeaway value, documented results, and ongoing team collaboration following the retreat.
  agenda:
    title: Retreat Schedule
    subtitle: 3 days, 2 nights
    text: "We believe that the Scrum framework is the best way to establish a goal and accomplish results. A successful retreat is based on Scrum - we form teams, create team visions, build backlogs, execute multiple sprints, review, retrospect, and adapt throughout the retreat. This provides for double learning: The team learns about primary focus of their work while inspecting/adapting to accomplish a goal; in addition, participants learn what it is like to be on a team and live Scrum in a very hyper-focused and intense way. A successful retreat will foster the formation of teams and the execution of multiple sprints for deeper learning."

        title: Registration
        time: 4PM - 5PM
        text: The kick-off will take part at the "Santander" room in the Holiday Inn Ezeiza Hotel. Just outside the door, we will welcome you. Take advantage of this timeslot for getting to know the other coaches with whom you will be collaborating during these days.
      teams:
        title: Team Formation / Topic Selection
        time: 5PM - 6PM
        text: "Teams are the heart of Scrum and a key differentiator in retreats. Teams allow for collaborative sharing, learning, and more impactful results. Allowing teams time to form, norm, storm, and perform provides a rich opportunity for learning about teams and learning on the subject of the team. Teams also have challenges -- team alienation, personality conflicts, leadership and role definitions, appropriate expertise, diversity, etc. Working with teams in such a short retreat format is a challenge and an opportunity. A successful retreat will leverage the pre- and post-retreat time to build relationships and lengthen the forming and norming cycle. It will also clearly articulate the team construct to participants throughout the process."
